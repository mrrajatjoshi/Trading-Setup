This setup is designed to streamline the process of opening tickers in Tradingview and DAS Trader.
I achieve this with a combination of Chrome Extension, Autohotkey Script and DAS Trader hotkeys.

Follow the below steps to setup your system.

1. Download and install Autohotkey
2. Place the "CopyPasteTickers.ahk" file in the Startup folder of your PC so it runs when the machine is turned on.
3. In Chrome, under the extensions enable developer mode.
4. Download the "short_text_copier" folder and save it somewhere on your computer
5. In Chtome, under the extensions, click on Load unpacked and select the "short_text_copier" folder to import it into chrome.
6. Pin the extension
7. In the settings for the extension, enable it and feel free to add the links from the "Stock Links.txt" file in the "short_text_copier resources" folder or any other links you may want, essentially the placeholder text "TICKERTEXT" will be replaced and new URLs will be opened by this extension if needed.
8. Create a DAS Trader hotkey "Shift+M" to change the window focus to the Montage. Oh, also, give your montage window a name in the frame window configuration.
9. Click on an element in Chrome when it is outlined in red to copy the text. By default it should only copy short text.
